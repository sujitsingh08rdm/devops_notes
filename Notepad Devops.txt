DEVOPS => devops is the set of practices that combines software developemnt ->  aim to automating and improving the flow of dev -> test -> deployment. So developement + operations.
build faster, depeloyement safer and easy to maintain.

PLAN -> DEVELOP -> BUILD -> TEST -> RELEASE -> DEPLOY -> MONITOR

UNIX => 
  navigation :
    pwd -> present working directory
    ls -> list all the files
    cd -> change directory
    cd Folder -> to go the Folder
    cd .. -> goes directory back
    cd / -> to goto root directory
    ls -l -> to give details of the the files
    ls -a -> to see hidden file
    touch newFile.txt -> to create a file called newFile.txt
    mkdir test -> to create a new folder/directory called test
    rm filename.txt -> to delete a file 
    rm -r foldername -> to delete a folder
    find -name "fewfile.txt" -> to find the file with name "" 
    grep "hello" newFile.txt -> to find a particular text "hello" inside a file

SHELL SCRIPTING =>
  script -> textfile -> series of commands of that the linux shell (bash) will execute.
  nano firstScriptFile.sh -> nano mean to create a shellScript file.
    /bin/bash
    echo "Hello Word"

  now exit to exit press ctrl+O -> enter -> ctrl+X

  chmod +x firstScriptFile.sh -> to make the script file executeable 
  ./firstScriptFile.sh -> to execute this script we will get "Hello Word"

  nano variables.sh 
  /bin/bash
  name = "sangam"
  echo "Hello $name!"

  execute it we will get Hello sangam!

  nano conditionals.sh
  number=5
  if [ $number -gt 5 ]; then 
    echo "The number is greater then 5"
  else
    echo "The numebr is not greater then 5"

  execute it 


GIT => 
git is a version control system that tracks changes in your source code.
github is cloud based hosting service


git branch -> to show branch
git branch "branchname" -> to create a new branch
git switch "branchname" -> to switch a branch
git switch -c "branchname" -> to create a branch and switch it
git branch -d "branchname" -> to delete branch
-now again do chanign a little code and try to publish the dev branch-
git switch dev
git add.
git commit -m "change in dev"
git push -u origin dev
-now to merge the changes to main branch from dev branch we will-
git switch main
git merge dev 
git push
git pull -> to get sync the branch from cloud to local.


DOCKER => 

docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx , to create a container , if nginx is nout found locally it will download, -d to run in detach mode(background), -p port (client:docker) 
docker ps -> show all the running containers
docker ps -a -> -a list all containers
docker stop <containerId> -> stop a running container
docker rm <containerId> -> to delete a container from docker (container should be in stop state)
docker prune -> to stop all the running docker containers
docker rmi <imagename> -> to remove an image
docker rmi -f <imagename> -> to remove an image by force
docker build -t mern-backend . -> -t tags the image that we can reference later
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name customName mern-backend ->  
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name customName --env-file.env mern-backend -> read the env filecontent 

same for frotnend

DOCKER COMPOSE => 

its a tool to comfig a multi-container app in a single-yaml
 
docker-compose up --build -d -> to run docker
docker-compose down -> to bring down everything 
docker-compose logs -> to view logs
